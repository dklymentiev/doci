# Changelog

All notable changes to DOCI are documented here.
This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Auth: accept email-format principals in the ForwardAuth `Remote-User`
  header. The validation regex was `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`, which rejected any
  username containing `@` or `.` -- i.e. every email identity from a
  ForwardAuth proxy. Trusted-proxy callers were silently dropped to
  `unknown` and returned `api.auth_failed`, so read endpoints (e.g.
  `list.php`) returned empty for those users. Widened to
  `^[a-zA-Z0-9_@.+-]+$` at both check sites (`src/config.php`: raw header
  and revalidation). Still bounded (no spaces/slashes/shell metacharacters)
  and honoured only from allowlisted proxy IPs.

## [0.2.0-rc] - 2026-05-24

This release closes the eight critical blockers raised by the rein
pre-release audit (see `executive_verdict` of task-20260524-175910)
and bundles the canonical-documents feature, full doc canon, and CI
work that had accumulated on `main` since v0.1.0.

### Added
- **Canonical documents** — curated registry, many-to-many onto domain
  strings (`marketing`, `support`, `incidents`, …). New endpoint
  `GET/POST/DELETE /api/key-document.php`, a **Canonical** switch in
  the page header (right of the GUID), and a **Canonical only** toggle
  at the top of the sidebar that collapses the tree to just those
  documents. Canonical files render bold + underlined; folders that
  contain a canonical descendant render bold.
- `migrations/002_key_documents.sql` — `key_documents` table + indexes.
- `migrations/003_hierarchy_full_chain.sql` — rewrite
  `get_document_hierarchy()` to walk both thread→version and
  version→original links so an AI prompt sees the full ancestry.
- Unit tests: `tests/Unit/MarkdownTest.php` (extract_title, HTML
  detection, thread-quote matching, footnote rewriting),
  `tests/Unit/MeshTest.php` (GUID derivation, skip-folder config),
  `tests/Unit/PathSafetyTest.php` (validate_path_within against a real
  temp directory).
- `docs/04-roadmap.md` — phased delivery with exit gates per phase.
- `docs/05-api-reference.md` — full HTTP API + CLI + MCP tool contract.
- `docs/06-testing-strategy.md` — test pyramid + mandatory live benchmark gate
  per Software Product Template v1.1.
- `docs/07-operations.md` — deploy, monitor, backup, incident runbook.
- `docs/08-changelog.md` — stub pointing at this file.
- `docs/09-doc-pipeline.md` — three documentation layers and how they stay current.
- `docs/quickstart.md` and `docs/monitoring.md`.
- `examples/` — runnable curl + Python REST clients, Claude Desktop MCP config.
- `schemas/` — JSON Schemas for `document`, `inbox`, `thread`, `version`.
- `RELEASING.md` — release checklist, semver policy, rollback plan.
- `Makefile` — operator shortcuts (`make help`, `lint`, `test`, `api-test`,
  `up`, `down`, `deploy`, `psql`, etc.).
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — CI matrix (PHP 8.2/8.3) running
  PHPUnit + PHPStan + `php -l` lint, now with a `postgres:16` service
  container and migrations applied before `composer test` so
  DB-backed tests actually exercise the database.
- `requirements.txt` — declares the two real MCP server runtime deps
  (`mcp>=1.0.0`, `httpx>=0.27.0`). Previously listed `asyncpg` and
  `click`, neither of which is imported anywhere; `mcp_server.py`
  was uninstallable from a clean `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Configuration env vars** introduced by the security hardening
  pass (all documented in `docs/07-operations.md` and `.env.example`):
  `DOCI_ENV`, `DOCI_DEV_AUTO_AUTH`, `DOCI_TRUSTED_PROXIES`,
  `DOCI_LOG_LEVEL`, `DOCI_MCP_HOST`.

### Changed
- **Root document is `files/README.md`, not `files/index.md`.** Router
  in `index.php` falls back to `README.md` when `index.md` is absent
  (search "Root-document fallback"). `$requestPath` stays as `'index'`
  internally, so nav / breadcrumbs / version-bar logic continues to
  treat it as the root. The editorial landing (TOC, three feature
  sections, Get started with MCP config, farm CTA, Read next) lives in
  README.md; the old `files/index.md` was deleted.
- **Sidebar tree hides `index.md` / `index.html`** at every level
  (`render_file_tree` in `lib/render.php`). They are the implicit
  landing of their level — listing them as a separate child duplicated
  the parent-click target.
- **Landing drops the appended folder-cards grid.** The root URL `/`
  now renders the curated landing only; sub-directory index pages
  still get folder/file cards (unchanged).
- **AI gateway** — `ai.php` now talks to any OpenAI-compatible
  `/chat/completions` endpoint via `AI_GATEWAY_URL`, replacing the
  previous internal gateway protocol.
- **Internal links** — saves rewrite `[text](relative/path)` references
  to their `documents.guid` form on write, not only at render time, so
  the markdown source stays stable when files are renamed.
- **Container start** — the entrypoint indexes anything in `files/`
  that has no DB row yet, so seeded markdown gets GUIDs on first boot
  without a manual `scripts/index-documents.php` call.
- `files/` wiped for landing rebuild (Phase 4 of the roadmap). Old demo content
  preserved in git history at commit `9cfa34d`.

### Removed
- `doci.local` as a hardcoded fallback for `DOCI_DOMAIN`. The variable
  is now required at boot; the container fails fast if it is missing.
- Hardcoded LAN bind in `mcp_server.py` (a specific private LAN address).
  SSE / streamable-http transports now require `DOCI_MCP_HOST`
  (use `127.0.0.1` for local-only, `0.0.0.0` for all interfaces); the
  process exits with code 2 if it is missing. Stdio transport is
  unaffected.

### Security
- **Dev-mode auto-auth split** (was: `DOCI_DEBUG=true`). The single
  flag granted full app access as user `dev` to any unauthenticated
  request -- a leaked env var in production was a complete bypass.
  Replaced with three independent vars: `DOCI_ENV`
  (development|production), `DOCI_DEV_AUTO_AUTH` (false by default),
  and `DOCI_DEBUG_LOG` (now `DOCI_LOG_LEVEL`, see below). Auto-auth
  requires BOTH `DOCI_DEV_AUTO_AUTH=true` AND `DOCI_ENV=development`;
  any other combination fails with HTTP 500 before any handler runs.
- **Remote-User trust boundary.** The `Remote-User` header was
  trusted from any source -- anyone able to reach the container
  directly (e.g. on `traefik-net`) could forge an admin identity.
  Now honoured only when `REMOTE_ADDR` matches an entry in the
  comma-separated `DOCI_TRUSTED_PROXIES` IPv4 / CIDR list. Default
  empty = strip every Remote-User header (API-key auth still works).
- **CSRF enforcement is now ON by default.** Earlier in the v0.2
  cycle the hidden `return;` at the top of `require_csrf_token()`
  was lifted into an explicit `DOCI_CSRF_ENABLED` env flag; the
  pre-release audit flagged opt-in as a misconfiguration trap and
  the default flipped to enforce. API-key callers remain exempt
  automatically; set `DOCI_CSRF_ENABLED=false` only for
  API-key-only deployments that never expose the browser flow.
- **Structured production logging with always-on security events.**
  `doci_log()` was binary-gated on the old `DOCI_DEBUG_LOG=true`;
  production therefore logged nothing application-level. Replaced
  with a real log threshold (`DOCI_LOG_LEVEL` = `ERROR` | `WARN` |
  `INFO` | `DEBUG`, default `WARN`) plus an always-on override for
  security actions (`auth.*`, `csrf.*`, `api.auth_*`, `*.delete.*`,
  `*.api_key_*`). The audit trail survives even at the lowest log
  level.
- **API attribution server-side only.** `handleCreate()` and
  `handleUpdate()` previously accepted `created_by` /
  `updated_by` from the request body; an API-key holder could
  attribute work to any user. Both fields are now derived strictly
  from `get_current_username()` and the body value is ignored.
- **Tag validation on update path.** `handleUpdate()` skipped
  `validate_tags()` and imploded raw values into the PostgreSQL
  array literal. Both create and update now call `validate_tags()`
  explicitly.
- **HTTP-level deny for `.git` and `files/.data/`.** `.htaccess`
  had no rules guarding either prefix -- commit packs, FETCH_HEAD,
  and pending AI context blobs were reachable over HTTP. Two
  `RedirectMatch 404` lines at the top of the rewrite block close
  both prefixes before the routing rule sees them.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-22

First open-source release. Code extracted from internal use at klymentiev.com.

### Features

- **Documents.** Hierarchical markdown documents with REST CRUD, GUID-stable
  identifiers, human-readable paths, soft delete, tags, parent/child links.
- **Inbox.** Quick capture of free-form notes; later promote to documents
  at a chosen path.
- **Threads.** Open discussions on a document or a selected quote inside
  it; threads are themselves first-class documents (`doc_type = 'thread'`).
- **Versions.** Snapshot a document into a version document
  (`doc_type = 'version'`) before edits; full chain queryable.
- **Git-backed storage.** Every create/update/delete is committed in the
  `files/` working tree; commit log doubles as audit trail.
- **AI thread replies.** Optional `ai.php` integration generates draft
  replies against an external AI gateway.
- **HTML documents.** Documents whose content is a full HTML page
  (starting with `<!DOCTYPE html>` or `<html>`) render in a sandboxed
  `<iframe>` (sandbox omits `allow-same-origin`).
- **Threads + versions UI.** Version bar at the top of every document
  (chips `Original | DV-1 | …`); right-click on a selection opens
  "Start Thread" which atomically creates a version + a thread
  anchored to the quoted passage; thread pages render the reply log
  with an inline reply textarea and optional AI reply checkbox.
- **MCP server.** `mcp_server.py` (FastMCP) exposes 12 tools for AI
  agents: `doci_create`, `doci_get`, `doci_update`, `doci_delete`,
  `doci_search`, `doci_inbox`, `doci_inbox_list`, `doci_thread`,
  `doci_threads`, `doci_reply`, `doci_versions`, `doci_health`.
- **Auth.** API key (`X-API-Key`, SHA-256 hashed at rest) and/or external
  auth via reverse proxy passing `Remote-User`. CSRF token for mutating
  HTTP methods.
- **Optional Mesh integration.** When `MESH_API_URL` is reachable,
  documents are indexed for semantic search via the companion project
  `mesh-memory` (https://github.com/dklymentiev/mesh-memory).

### Known limitations

- No multi-tenant isolation. Single org / single git repo per instance.
- No built-in user management. Auth is delegated to a reverse proxy or
  to API key holders.
- CSRF enforcement is opt-in (`DOCI_CSRF_ENABLED=true`); default is
  disabled while the gate is being hardened in Phase 5 of the roadmap.
- No built-in search endpoint; the architecture doc previously listed a
  `search.php` route that was never shipped. Path/title/tag lookup works
  through `GET /api/documents.php?path=…`; semantic search requires the
  optional Mesh integration.
